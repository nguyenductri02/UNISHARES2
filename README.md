# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Environment Setup

### Required Environment Variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure the following variables:

```env
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
REACT_APP_PUSHER_KEY=your_pusher_app_key
REACT_APP_PUSHER_CLUSTER=your_pusher_cluster
```

### Pusher Setup (Optional)

Real-time chat features require Pusher configuration:

1. Create a free account at [Pusher.com](https://pusher.com/)
2. Create a new app in your Pusher dashboard
3. Copy the App Key and Cluster from your Pusher app settings
4. Add them to your `.env` file

**Note:** If Pusher is not configured, the app will fall back to polling mode. Chat will still work but real-time updates will have a delay.

## Installation and Running

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

The app will run on `http://localhost:3000`
